                        </div>
                        <p>The goal of Tien Len is to be the first player to git rid of all your cards. The person with the lowest card starts the game and can play any of the hands (ex. Single, Straight) to start the game.</p>
                        <p>When a player plays a hand, the other players must play a hand of the same type. Example:</p> 

                        <p><em>Player 1</em> plays <strong>THREE&spades; + THREE&hearts;</strong> (Two of a Kind) the other players must play a <strong>Two of a Kind</strong>.</p> 
                        <p>In the end, the player that plays the hand that noone else can beat <strong>takes over</strong> the game. At this point, the player can choose to play whatever hand he desires because he is the leader.</p>
                        <p><em>Rinse and repeat</em> and you have a game of <strong>Tien Len 13!</strong></p>
